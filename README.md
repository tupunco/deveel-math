Deveel Math
===========

This is the port of the Java Math library implemented by the Apache Harmony framework, that is used to factorize big numbers and decimals, for the .NET and Mono frameworks.
In fact the native .NET support for decimal numbers appear to be limited in several contexts, leading some independent developments of the support within applications.

Tha aim of this library is to provide .NET developers with a powerful instrument to handle operations on very big numbers, keeping performances and reliability under control.


How to Install It
==================
The library is maintained in two separate repositories from where it is possible to install it: in fact, the nightly builds can be found at the dedicated space of MyGet, while the production packages can be found at nuget.org 
From the NuGet Package Management console, select the project where the library will be installed and type the following command

```
PM> Install-Package dmath
```

 If you are developing a .NET Standard or .NET Core application, you can install the `dmath.core` library instead
  
```
PM> Install-Package dmath.core
```
